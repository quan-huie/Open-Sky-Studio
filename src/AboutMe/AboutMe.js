      <h2>About Mia</h2>
      <p>
        Mia is the owner/director of Open Sky Studio
        and has an extensive background in bodywork
        and wellness. She studied Pilates in New York
        City with Romana Kryzanowska (personally chosen
        by Joseph Pilates to be the custodian of his
        entire body of work) for three years and became
        certified by Romana in Authentic Pilates in 1992.

        Mia began dancing at the age of 2 and got her
        BFA in dance from Cornish College of the Arts,
        she danced professionally, was a Sports & fitness
        director for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, a lifelong
        student of Yoga- there has never been a time in Mia’s
        life where she wasn’t focused on physical wellness.

      <p>
        After traveling to Rishekesh India for an intensive 6
        week Yoga certification, Mia decided to focus her energy
        on a deeper, more meaningful pursuit than physical fitness.
        In the same way that she finally understood that Yoga
        eventually leads to stillness, meditation and quieting
        the mind, she now see’s how the fitness world she had
        identified so deeply with is entrenched in diet culture.
        Mia is dedicated to offering a space that does not focus
        on the pursuit of thinness and calling it wellness.
        Focusing on her own relationship with food, exercise
        and her weight has illuminated a deep desire to help
        others find peace in their bodies.
