                has studied with many teachers and practiced different 
                techniques through the years. In 2018 Mia traveled to 
                Rishikesh India to become certified in yoga and meditation 
                from the Sattva Yoga Academy. During this immersive experience, 
                she saw that all the physical disciplines she had practiced and 
                taught her entire life were the gateway into the ultimate goal of a 
                much deeper, real & sustainable pursuit: Peace of Mind.

               business in 2020 to better reflect the evolution of her lifeâ€™s 
               work. Transitioning the primary focus from Pilates and physical 
               fitness toward a deeper, sustainable, peaceful relationship with 
               our bodies, our minds & our emotions.
